7DtD Placeable Mech Protector (DMT)

A Mech Robot that you can craft and place to defend your base for 7 Days to Die.

Created for A18(B4).

Hard dependencies:
 1.   0-CreaturePackMechs - https://github.com/7D2D/A18Mods/ as it links to the models and sounds from that mod.
 2.   0-SphereIICore - https://tinyurl.com/vyzvt79
 3.   SphereIICORE needs to be compiled with DMT Modding Tool - https://github.com/HAL-NINE-THOUSAND/DMT

The Craftable Mech uses the model for the miniBike to place the mech for now because using the mech's own model will not allow it to be placed on the ground for some reason.
